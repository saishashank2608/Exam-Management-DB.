# üéì University Examination System - Database Project

This project represents a **University Examination System** using SQL and Entity-Relationship design. It efficiently manages the data related to students, courses, departments, faculty members, exams, enrollments, and attendance.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a relational database schema for a university‚Äôs examination management system. The system covers:

- Department-wise course offerings
- Faculty responsibilities
- Student enrollment and attendance
- Exam creation and attempt tracking

---

## üß± ER Design Description

### üè¢ Department
- Each department has a unique ID and name.
- Departments offer multiple courses.
- Each department is headed by a faculty member.

### üìö Course
- Each course has a unique ID and name.
- Every course belongs to one department.
- Courses are taught and coordinated by faculty.

### üë®‚Äçüè´ Faculty
- Faculty members have an ID and name.
- A faculty member can:
  - Teach multiple courses
  - Create exams
  - Head a department

### üßë‚Äçüéì Student
- Each student has a unique roll number (ID) and name.
- A student belongs to one department.
- A student can enroll in multiple courses.
- For each course, attendance is recorded.
- Students can appear for multiple exams and have multiple attempts per exam.

### üìù Exam
- Each exam is linked to a course and created by a faculty member.
- Contains fields like title, subject, date, duration, and type (internal/external).
- Students can attempt exams multiple times.

### üìä Attendance
- Attendance is tracked per student per course.

## üóÇÔ∏è Tables and Relationships

### Student Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    S_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    S_Name VARCHAR(100),
    D_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (D_id) REFERENCES Department(D_id)
);
```

### Department Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    D_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    D_Name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Course Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Course (
    C_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    C_Name VARCHAR(100),
    D_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (D_id) REFERENCES Department(D_id)
);
```

### Faculty Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Faculty (
    F_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Faculty_Name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Teaches Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Teaches (
    F_ID INT,
    C_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (F_ID) REFERENCES Faculty(F_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (C_id) REFERENCES Course(C_id)
);
```

### Exam Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Exam (
    Exam_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Subject VARCHAR(100),
    Type VARCHAR(50),
    Date DATE,
    Duration INT,
    Faculty_id INT,
    C_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Faculty_id) REFERENCES Faculty(F_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (C_id) REFERENCES Course(C_id)
);
```

### Attendance Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Attendance (
    S_id INT,
    C_id INT,
    Attendance_Percentage DECIMAL(5,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (S_id, C_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (S_id) REFERENCES Student(S_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (C_id) REFERENCES Course(C_id)
);
```

### Enrollment Table (Recommended)
```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    S_id INT,
    C_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (S_id, C_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (S_id) REFERENCES Student(S_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (C_id) REFERENCES Course(C_id)
);
```

- Insert and query **relational data** effectively

---

## ‚úÖ Future Enhancements

- Add `Marks` and `Attempt` tracking for each exam attempt
- Introduce `HeadOfDepartment` field in Department referencing Faculty
- Create views and stored procedures for exam reports and attendance summaries

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL or SQLite)
- ER Modeling (draw.io or similar
